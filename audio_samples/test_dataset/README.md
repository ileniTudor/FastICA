The audio signals, used in experiments, are collected from the public dataset of the Community-Based Signal Separation Evaluation Camping (SiSEC) 2015. They provide a set of audio files represented the mixture and also the independent components of each mixture. For our tests we use only the initial independent sources. We put together all the independent given sources (from all mixtures) and we create pairs of two different sources. In this way, we get 182 such samples (pairs). We used those pairs, of independent sources (s1, s2), in order to create different mixtures (s1 +s2 +rand noise) and then we try to recover the initial components (s1, s2).
